# Metagenomics Analysis Notes

## Important Note
**This directory contains notes and code examples for metagenomic sequencing data analysis rather than directly executable pipelines.**

These materials are intended as reference and learning resources, not as turnkey solutions. You will need to adapt and modify the code to fit your specific data and analysis requirements.

## Contents
This directory includes notes and code examples for:
- Preprocessing of metagenomic data
- Taxonomic classification of sequences
- Functional annotation of metagenomes
- Comparative metagenomics analysis
- Microbial community diversity analysis
- Statistical methods for microbiome studies
- Visualization techniques for metagenomic data

## How to Use
- Use these notes as a starting point for developing your own analysis workflows
- Refer to the code examples to understand the logic and parameters for different analysis steps
- Adapt and modify the code to suit your specific experimental design and biological questions

## Software References
The notes reference various software packages commonly used in metagenomics analysis, including:
- QIIME2
- MetaPhlAn
- Kraken2
- HUMAnN
- MEGAN
- Galaxy
- DADA2
- PhyloSeq

Please refer to the official documentation of these tools for installation and detailed usage instructions.
