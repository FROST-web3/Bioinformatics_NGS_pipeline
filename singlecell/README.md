# Single-cell Sequencing Analysis Notes

## Important Note
**This directory contains notes and code examples for single-cell sequencing data analysis rather than directly executable pipelines.** 

These materials are intended as reference and learning resources, not as turnkey solutions. You will need to adapt and modify the code to fit your specific data and analysis requirements.

## Contents
This directory includes notes and code examples for:
- Quality control and filtering of single-cell data
- Preprocessing and normalization techniques
- Dimensionality reduction methods (PCA, t-SNE, UMAP)
- Cell clustering algorithms
- Cell type annotation approaches
- Differential expression analysis
- Trajectory inference

## How to Use
- Use these notes as a starting point for developing your own analysis workflows
- Refer to the code examples to understand the logic and parameters for different analysis steps
- Adapt and modify the code to suit your specific experimental design and biological questions

## Software References
The notes reference various software packages commonly used in single-cell analysis, including:
- Seurat (R)
- Scanpy (Python)
- Monocle/Monocle3
- Cell Ranger
- SCDE
- Velocyto

Please refer to the official documentation of these tools for installation and detailed usage instructions.
